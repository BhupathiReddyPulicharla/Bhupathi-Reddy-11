A feature is a distinctive trait or a special attraction. Feature can also mean to give special attention to something. The word feature has several other senses as a noun and a verb. A feature is a unique quality or characteristic that something has.
A feature story is a piece of longform non-fiction content that covers a single topic in detail. Examples of feature stories include news features, in-depth profiles, human interest stories, science communication, data storytelling, and more.
A feature is a longer piece of writing than a news story. Features come in many different types and are widely used in magazines, newspapers and online. A feature will often cover an issue in greater depth than a news story would do; or it might look at an ongoing story from a different angle.
An example of feature is freckles. An example of feature is a guest speaker at an event. An example of feature is a cover story in a magazine. An example of feature is a new movie coming out.
In Convolutional neural network, the kernel is nothing but a filter that is used to extract the features from the images. The kernel is a matrix that moves over the input data, performs the dot product with the sub-region of input data, and gets the output as the matrix of dot products.
Edges represents the object boundaries. So edge detection is a very important preprocessing step for any object detection or recognition process. Simple edge detection kernels are based on approximation of gradient images. Another advanced edge detection algorithms will discussed in details
In order to discover the vertical edges in this image, we can construct a 3 \times 3 matrix. Using the terminology of the convolutional neural networks, we will call it a filter. Sometimes researchers call this a kernel instead of a filter, but we will use the filter terminology.
In image processing, a kernel, convolution matrix, or mask is a small matrix used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more. This is accomplished by doing a convolution between the kernel and an image.

An image kernel is a small matrix used to apply effects like the ones you might find in Photoshop or Gimp, such as blurring, sharpening, outlining or embossing. They're also used in machine learning for 'feature extraction', a technique for determining the most important portions of an image.
Limiting the number of parameters, we are limiting the number of unrelated features possible. This forces Machine Learning algorithm to learn features common to different situations and so to generalize better. Hence common choice is to keep the kernel size at 3x3 or 5x5.

One of the reason to prefer small kernel sizes over fully connected network is that it reduces computational costs and weight sharing that ultimately leads to lesser weights for back-propagation.
A common choice is to keep the kernel size at 3x3 or 5x5. The first convolutional layer is often kept larger. Its size is less important as there is only one first layer, and it has fewer input channels: 3, 1 by color.
In other words we will need two (3x3x3) kernels, or equivalently we can say that we trained six different (3x3) masks. So we use two 3x3x3 kernels to perform convolutions to go from a 32x32x3 input image to two different 32x32 feature maps (32x32x3 to 32x32x2).
Bits or characters that fill up unused portions of a data structure, such as a field, packet or frame. Typically, padding is done at the end of the structure to fill it up with data, with the padding usually consisting of 1 bits, blank characters or null characters.
US. : to deal with (something difficult or upsetting) in a calm way I thought she'd be upset, but she has taken the news in stride.An element's padding area is the space between its content and its border. Note: Padding creates extra space within an element. In contrast, margin creates extra space around an element
To stride is to walk along, especially with large steps. An example of stride is when you walk down the street purposefully, wanting to quickly get to your destination. verb. 1. The definition of an example of stride is a long step or working in such a way to make good progress.
Description. A 2-D convolutional layer applies sliding convolutional filters to 2-D input. The layer convolves the input by moving the filters along the input vertically and horizontally and computing the dot product of the weights and the input, and then adding a bias term.
1) : a path along which information (such as data or music) in the form of an electrical signal passes. (2) channels plural : a fixed or official course of communication went through established military channels with his grievances. e : a way, course, or direction of thought or action new channels of exploration.
domain, you simply multiply the signal(X)-which is matrix with Signal(Y), which is also a matrix. So, now you will be able to understand that, Yes convolution is same as matrix multiplication(where matrix X and Y matrix of signal) but ONLY IN FREQUENCY DOMAIN
Yes, it is possible and you should also use a doubly block circulant matrix (which is a special case of Toeplitz matrix). I will give you an example with a small size of kernel and the input, but it is possible to construct Toeplitz matrix for any kernel.
Convolution is the treatment of a matrix by another one which is called “kernel”. The Convolution Matrix filter uses a first matrix which is the Image to be treated. The image is a bi-dimensional collection of pixels in rectangular coordinates. The used kernel depends on the effect you want.
Senior Member. Well you can only convolve a vector with a vector. So to convolve a matrix with a vector you are going to have to break that matrix up into vectors somehow, the obvious choices being using the row vectors, or using the column vectors
The simple answer is that discrete convolution is equivalent to taking a dot product between the filter weights and the values underneath the filter, and, geometrically, dot products measure vector similarity.
In the context of CNN, convolution is a linear operation involving the multiplication of a set of weights with the input images represented by metrics similar to traditional neural networks. Here an array of weights is called a filter or kernel. Fig1: Convolution operation.
C = conv2( A , B ) returns the two-dimensional convolution of matrices A and B . C = conv2( u , v , A ) first convolves each column of A with the vector u , and then it convolves each row of the result with the vector v . C = conv2(___, shape ) returns a subsection of the convolution according to shape .
